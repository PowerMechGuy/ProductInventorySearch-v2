They support multiple combinations of Ethernet ports, all in a single slot of the Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers (ASR 9000 Series). These modular line cards have two open bays (bay 0 and bay 1) for plugging in ASR 9000 Series Modular Port Adapters (MPA), which gives network operators the flexibility to choose the ideal port density, speed, and optic based on their network requirements. With ASR 9000 Series modular line cards and the MPA portfolio, Cisco continues to focus on investment protection, along with consistent feature support, broad interface availability, and the latest technology. The latest additions to the MPA portfolio include the Cisco ASR 9000 Series 20-Port 10GE Modular Port Adapter, the 2-Port 100GE Modular Port Adapter, the 1-port 100G Modular Port Adapter and the MACSec enabled 32 port 1GE Modular Port Adapter.\u00a0 Using modular line cards along with port adapters, the ASR 9000 Series can support a wide range of customer applications, including video on demand, Internet Protocol Television (IPTV), point-to-point video, Internet video, and cloud-based computing. The line cards can also be used to deliver economical, scalable, highly available, line\u2011rate Ethernet, and IP/Multiprotocol Label Switching (IP/MPLS) edge services. Cisco ASR 9000 Series line cards and routers are designed to provide the fundamental infrastructure for scalable Carrier Ethernet and IP/MPLS networks, supporting profitable business, residential, and mobile services.

Total bandwidth is dependent on the number and type of RSPs installed. The new 200G modular line cards deliver the ability to mix and match modular port adapters so that customers can customize each slot in the ASR 9000 to their specific port demands. For example, in the case of a 200G modular line card, two 1-port 100 Gigabit Ethernet modular port adapters can be used per slot for a total of 200 gigabits per slot, or a single 2-port 100 Gigabit Ethernet or a single 20-port 10 Gigabit Ethernet modular port adapter can be used to get 200 gigabits per slot. The 200G modular cards are compatible with all earlier generations of port adapters. The new 32 port 1 Gigabit Ethernet modular port adapter in additional to all features, supports the hop by hop as well as WAN MACSec encryption. MACSec is the next-generation encryption technology in federal, enterprise, cloud and service provider transport networks. WAN MACSec provides capability to deploy seamlessly over any public carrier Ethernet, optical, DWDM/OTN transport network. The Cisco ASR 9000 Series 200G Modular Line Cards provide simultaneous support for both Layer 2 and Layer 3 services and features. This capability helps operators qualify and stock a single line card that can be deployed in any combination of Layer 2 and Layer 3 applications.

It empowers midsize and large enterprises that are rapidly deploying cloud-scale applications with Inter-Switch Link (ISL) consolidation by four to one over traditional 10Gbps FCoE and three to one over 16Gbps FC, and exceptional investment protection for their SANs. The data center fabric is already using 40-Gbps connectivity in the core for more efficient convergence, higher performance, and lower total cost of ownership (TCO). With the entire Cisco Nexus\u00ae\u00a0Family supporting 40-Gbps FCoE, this capability can now be extended to the SAN core. You can extend the benefits of FCoE beyond the access layer to the data center core with a full line-rate FCoE module for the Cisco MDS 9700 Series Multilayer Directors.\nThe main features of the MDS 9700 40-Gbps 24-Port FCoE Module include:\n\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0High performance: MDS 9700 Series architecture, based on central arbitration and crossbar fabric, provides 40-Gbps line-rate, non-blocking, predictable performance across all traffic conditions for every FCoE port in the chassis.\n\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CAPEX reduction: The 40Gbps FCoE capable ports support QSFP-40G-SR4-BD transceivers that allow users to deploy them on existing 10Gbps cable plants without having to rip and replace existing cabling in their data center thus greatly reducing capital expenditure.\n\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Higher Bandwidth: FCoE takes advantage of full bandwidth utilization on a 40-Gbps Ethernet link to provide 294 percent the bandwidth of 16-Gbps Fibre Channel (the actual throughput of 16-Gbps Fibre Channel is 13.6 Gbps). Therefore, you need fewer 40-Gbps links to achieve the same bandwidth as with multiple 16-Gbps links.\n\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0High availability: MDS 9700 Series directors provide outstanding availability and reliability. These are the industry's first director-class switches that offer redundancy on all major components. They provide grid redundancy on the power supply and 1+1 redundant supervisors. Users can also can add fabric cards to enable N+1 fabric redundancy.\n\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Scalability: The MDS 9700 FCoE module provides up to 384 40-Gbps, full line-rate, ports in a single Cisco MDS 9718 Multilayer Director chassis or 192 40-Gbps, full line-rate, autosensing ports in a single Cisco MDS 9710 Multilayer Director chassis or up to 96 40-Gbps full line-rate ports in a single Cisco MDS 9706 Multilayer Director chassis.\n\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Resilient high-performance ISLs: FCoE ISLs can be grouped into port channels with up to 16 physical links, creating massive 640-Gbps logical links. When you connect to Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Switches populated with Cisco Nexus 7000 Series 40 Gigabit Ethernet modules, you can easily scale the number of director-class FCoE ports to meet the needs of the most demanding data center environments.\n\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Intelligent network services: VSAN technology, access control lists (ACLs) for hardware-based intelligent frame processing, and fabricwide quality of service (QoS) enable migration from SAN islands to enterprisewide storage networks.\n\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sophisticated diagnostics: The MDS 9700 FCoE module provides intelligent diagnostics, protocol decoding, network analysis tools, and integrated Cisco Call Home capability for greater reliability, faster problem resolution, and reduced service costs.\n\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Programmable fabric: The MDS 9700 Series provides powerful representational state transfer (REST) and Cisco NX-API capabilities to enable flexible and rapid programming of utilities for the SAN.\nWe offer free FedEx Ground shipping to all our customers in the continental US.

By using Cisco ASR 901 routers, operators can reduce backhaul operating costs, simplify and converge their RAN and Ethernet access networks, and enhance their profit opportunities with mobile and premium Ethernet services.RAN cell sites are places of transformation between mobile radio and mobile transport networks. Cost-effective RAN backhaul requires the ability to securely aggregate the transport of traffic from both traditional and next\u2011generation radios across multiple transport options available at the cell site, be they macro, pico, or enterprise small cells. The Cisco ASR 901 routers are designed to minimize operating costs and optimize this radio-to-transport transformation through scalable time-division multiplexing (TDM) and IP/Ethernet interfaces for any combination of multivendor, multigeneration radios and transport networks.Product OverviewThe Cisco ASR 901 Series Aggregation Services Routers are compact cell-site and Ethernet access routers specifically designed to clock, aggregate, and backhaul mixed-generation RAN traffic. Cisco ASR 901 routers prioritize and process cell-site voice, data, and signaling traffic as part of the Cisco Unified RAN Backhaul solution for reliable transport across any available backhaul networks, including T1/E1, ATM, Carrier Ethernet, microwave, WiMAX, and service provider Wi-Fi networks.Designed for cell sites and Carrier Ethernet access, the Cisco ASR 901 differentiating features include:\u25cf Low power consumption\u25cf Line rate performance for all Layer 2 and Layer 3 interfaces\u25cf Flexible clocking options: TDM, Building Integrated Timing Supply (BITS), GPS (10Mhz, 1PPS/ToD),1588v2, and Synchronous Ethernet (SyncE)\nMajor ApplicationsCell-Site Backhaul for Mobile ApplicationsDeployed as cell-site routers for mobile backhaul, the Cisco ASR 901 routers can aggregate multiple base stations through multiple TDM, Ethernet, and IP interfaces, and can use Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), Resilient Ethernet Protocol (REP), Multilink Point-to-Point Protocol (MLPPP), Layer 2 VPN (L2VPN), Layer 3 VPN (L3VPN), and other common transport protocols for RAN backhaul. Essentially, the routers prioritize, differentiate, and segment any combination of 2G, 3G, or 4G traffic for backhaul over any combination of IP/Ethernet and TDM (E1/T1) infrastructures (copper, microwave, or optical).Enterprise Small Cell BackhaulMobile traffic will now traverse from enterprise networks across public networks, so it is essential to protect the integrity of both enterprise and carrier data. To provide secure transport across any enterprise network, a high-performance IPSec acceleration engine is required. At the same time, it is important to be able to manage both public and private networks through support for NAPT. The Cisco ASR 901 provides secure mobile transport to satisfy the evolving backhaul requirements of deploying enterprise small cells.Metro Ethernet AccessCisco ASR 901 routers allow service providers to simultaneously manage and operate Pseudowire Emulation Edge to Edge (PWE3) and Carrier Ethernet environments by supporting line-rate Layer 2 Ethernet operations, administration, and maintenance (EOAM), including Connectivity Fault Management (CFM), Ethernet Local Management Interface (E-LMI), REP, QinQ, and link aggregation.Business Access DeviceCisco ASR 901 routers are optimized for remote-access and small aggregation sites where a fully featured, compact access platform is needed. The routers offer business service flexibility using an Ethernet virtual circuit (EVC) infrastructure and deliver Layer 2, IP, and MPLS transport for advanced Layer 2 and Layer 3 VPN services.\nBenefitsCisco ASR 901 routers help service providers deliver advanced services and reduce operating costs for mobile backhaul and Carrier Ethernet access solutions. Highlights include the following.Network SimplificationCisco network virtualization technology can simplify network operations by reducing the number of components that must be managed, supporting easier configuration. The Cisco ASR 901 supports Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) and autonomic networking and service activation to accelerate network deployment and service turn-up. The result is increased network scalability, improved service velocity, and lower operating costs. Capable of network virtualization, Cisco ASR 901 routers can be deployed as satellites of a Cisco ASR 9000 Series system to reduce the complexity of today\u2019s mobile Internet networks.Service ScalabilityCisco ASR 901 routers deliver line-rate performance and flexible service scalability in a compact form factor. With support for up to 32,000 MAC addresses, up to 4000 bridge domains, and multiple hierarchical queues, the routers deliver high performance and scale for all mobile and Carrier Ethernet services.Comprehensive ServicesWith Cisco ASR 901 routers, services can be prioritized and differentiated through hierarchical quality of service (HQoS) and security attributes. The routers offer advanced traffic analytics and performance monitoring and control, including per-traffic-class metering, bidirectional packets, and byte statistics. The service offering is enhanced with comprehensive OAM functionality, including Layer 2 CFM, IP service-level agreements (SLAs) for Layer 3, IPSec and NAPT for enterprise small cell backhaul, and MPLS OAM and TDM advanced timing and synchronization.Advanced TimingCisco ASR 901 routers provide the timing services required in today\u2019s converged access networks by offering integrated support for the BITS, 10-MHz, 1 pulse-per-second (PPS), and time-of-day (ToD) interfaces. The routers support SyncE on copper and optical ports and IEEE1588v2 Precision Time Protocol (PTP) clock recovery from T1 and E1 ports.Reliable DeploymentA Cisco end-to-end mobile backhaul solution offers the carrier greater confidence in the delivery of a truly carrier-class mobile backhaul network. Through transport and service redundancy, the Cisco architecture helps assure network availability, resiliency, and best-in-class performance.\u25cf Secure Mobile Transport: with IPSec and Network Address Port Translation (NAPT)\u25cf Extended operating temperatures\u25cf Small form factor: 1 rack unit (RU) with 8.3 - 9.1 in. depth\u25cf Redundant power and cooling\nWe offer free FedEx Ground shipping to all our customers in the continental US.

Modular line cards support a wide range of interfaces and densities offering the benefits of network scalability with lower initial costs and ease of upgrades. The Cisco ASR 9000 modular line cards and modular port adapter portfolio continues the Cisco focus on investment protection along with consistent feature support, broad interface availability, and the latest technology. Using the modular line cards, the Cisco ASR 9000 Series can support customer applications including video-on-demand, Internet Protocol Television (IPTV), point-to-point video, Internet video, and cloud-based computing. These line cards can also be used to deliver economical, scalable, highly available, line-rate Ethernet and IP/Multiprotocol Label Switching (IP/MPLS) edge services. The Cisco ASR 9000 Series line cards and routers are designed to provide the fundamental infrastructure for scalable Carrier Ethernet and IP/MPLS networks, supporting profitable business, residential, and mobile services The Cisco ASR 9000 Series modular line cards are fully compatible with the Cisco ASR 9922, 9010, and 9006 systems, route switch processors (RSPs), and line cards. No hardware upgrade to the chassis or cooling system is required. Total bandwidth is dependent on the number and type of RSPs installed. The new line cards deliver the ability to mix and match modular port adapters so that customers can customize each slot in the Cisco ASR 9000 to their specific port demands. As an example, a 4-port 10-Gigabit Ethernet modular port adapter can be matched with a 20-port 1-Gigabit Ethernet modular port adapter, all in a single slot. Each Cisco ASR 9000 Series modular line card provides simultaneous support for both Layer 2 and Layer 3 services and features, helping operators to qualify and stock a single line card that can be deployed in any combination of Layer 2 and Layer 3 applications. These capabilities help to reduce capital expenditures (CapEx) and operating expenses (OpEx), as well as reduce the time required to develop and deploy new services. The Cisco modular line cards set a new standard for service density, allowing operators to offer predictable, managed transport services while optimizing the use of network assets. The line cards, with their synchronization circuitry and dedicated backplane timing traces for accessing the RSP\u2019s Stratum-3 subsystem, provide standards-based line-interface functions for delivering and deriving transport-class network timing, allowing support of network-synchronized services and applications such as mobile backhaul and time-division multiplexing (TDM) migration. Coupled with the Cisco RSP-440 route switch processor, the line cards can also be used for applications requiring IEEE 1588v2 synchronization services. Recognizing that real-time media dominate next-generation services, Cisco has integrated media-monitoring technology into the Cisco Modular line cards. This multimedia technology allows real-time monitoring and statistics collection of real-time video and voice flows, facilitating proactive maintenance and management of today\u2019s interactive services. Addressing the advantages of consolidating IP and dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) networking, G.709 with Advanced Forward Error Correction (FEC) is provided. G.709 provides visibility into the DWDM transmission system to permit rapid detection and recovery from transmission-layer and DWDM impairments. G.709 can also be configured for proactive protection if signal degradation is detected; it prevents traffic loss and link outage. Advanced FEC extends transmission-layer performance, delivering extended performance over an amplified system without the cost of regeneration or transponders. The Cisco ASR 9000 Series modular line cards are available in Service Edge Optimized and Packet Transport Optimized variants.\u25cf Service Edge Optimized line cards are designed for customer deployments requiring enhanced quality of service (QoS).\u25cf Packet Transport Optimized line cards are designed for network deployments where basic QoS is required.Different line card types may be mixed within the same system.

Cost-effective RAN backhaul requires the ability to securely aggregate the transport of traffic from both traditional and next\u2011generation radios across multiple transport options available at the cell site, be they macro, pico, or enterprise small cells. The Cisco ASR 901 routers are designed to minimize operating costs and optimize this radio-to-transport transformation through scalable time-division multiplexing (TDM) and IP/Ethernet interfaces for any combination of multivendor, multigeneration radios and transport networks.Product OverviewThe Cisco ASR 901 Series Aggregation Services Routers are compact cell-site and Ethernet access routers specifically designed to clock, aggregate, and backhaul mixed-generation RAN traffic. Cisco ASR 901 routers prioritize and process cell-site voice, data, and signaling traffic as part of the Cisco Unified RAN Backhaul solution for reliable transport across any available backhaul networks, including T1/E1, ATM, Carrier Ethernet, microwave, WiMAX, and service provider Wi-Fi networks.Designed for cell sites and Carrier Ethernet access, the Cisco ASR 901 differentiating features include:\u25cf Low power consumption\u25cf Line rate performance for all Layer 2 and Layer 3 interfaces\u25cf Flexible clocking options: TDM, Building Integrated Timing Supply (BITS), GPS (10Mhz, 1PPS/ToD),1588v2, and Synchronous Ethernet (SyncE)\nMajor ApplicationsCell-Site Backhaul for Mobile ApplicationsDeployed as cell-site routers for mobile backhaul, the Cisco ASR 901 routers can aggregate multiple base stations through multiple TDM, Ethernet, and IP interfaces, and can use Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), Resilient Ethernet Protocol (REP), Multilink Point-to-Point Protocol (MLPPP), Layer 2 VPN (L2VPN), Layer 3 VPN (L3VPN), and other common transport protocols for RAN backhaul. Essentially, the routers prioritize, differentiate, and segment any combination of 2G, 3G, or 4G traffic for backhaul over any combination of IP/Ethernet and TDM (E1/T1) infrastructures (copper, microwave, or optical).Enterprise Small Cell BackhaulMobile traffic will now traverse from enterprise networks across public networks, so it is essential to protect the integrity of both enterprise and carrier data. To provide secure transport across any enterprise network, a high-performance IPSec acceleration engine is required. At the same time, it is important to be able to manage both public and private networks through support for NAPT. The Cisco ASR 901 provides secure mobile transport to satisfy the evolving backhaul requirements of deploying enterprise small cells.Metro Ethernet AccessCisco ASR 901 routers allow service providers to simultaneously manage and operate Pseudowire Emulation Edge to Edge (PWE3) and Carrier Ethernet environments by supporting line-rate Layer 2 Ethernet operations, administration, and maintenance (EOAM), including Connectivity Fault Management (CFM), Ethernet Local Management Interface (E-LMI), REP, QinQ, and link aggregation.Business Access DeviceCisco ASR 901 routers are optimized for remote-access and small aggregation sites where a fully featured, compact access platform is needed. The routers offer business service flexibility using an Ethernet virtual circuit (EVC) infrastructure and deliver Layer 2, IP, and MPLS transport for advanced Layer 2 and Layer 3 VPN services.\nBenefitsCisco ASR 901 routers help service providers deliver advanced services and reduce operating costs for mobile backhaul and Carrier Ethernet access solutions. Highlights include the following.Network SimplificationCisco network virtualization technology can simplify network operations by reducing the number of components that must be managed, supporting easier configuration. The Cisco ASR 901 supports Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) and autonomic networking and service activation to accelerate network deployment and service turn-up. The result is increased network scalability, improved service velocity, and lower operating costs. Capable of network virtualization, Cisco ASR 901 routers can be deployed as satellites of a Cisco ASR 9000 Series system to reduce the complexity of today\u2019s mobile Internet networks.Service ScalabilityCisco ASR 901 routers deliver line-rate performance and flexible service scalability in a compact form factor. With support for up to 32,000 MAC addresses, up to 4000 bridge domains, and multiple hierarchical queues, the routers deliver high performance and scale for all mobile and Carrier Ethernet services.Comprehensive ServicesWith Cisco ASR 901 routers, services can be prioritized and differentiated through hierarchical quality of service (HQoS) and security attributes. The routers offer advanced traffic analytics and performance monitoring and control, including per-traffic-class metering, bidirectional packets, and byte statistics. The service offering is enhanced with comprehensive OAM functionality, including Layer 2 CFM, IP service-level agreements (SLAs) for Layer 3, IPSec and NAPT for enterprise small cell backhaul, and MPLS OAM and TDM advanced timing and synchronization.Advanced TimingCisco ASR 901 routers provide the timing services required in today\u2019s converged access networks by offering integrated support for the BITS, 10-MHz, 1 pulse-per-second (PPS), and time-of-day (ToD) interfaces. The routers support SyncE on copper and optical ports and IEEE1588v2 Precision Time Protocol (PTP) clock recovery from T1 and E1 ports.Reliable DeploymentA Cisco end-to-end mobile backhaul solution offers the carrier greater confidence in the delivery of a truly carrier-class mobile backhaul network.

Modular line cards support a wide range of interfaces and densities offering the benefits of network scalability with lower initial costs and ease of upgrades. The Cisco ASR 9000 modular line cards and modular port adapter portfolio continues the Cisco focus on investment protection along with consistent feature support, broad interface availability, and the latest technology. Using the modular line cards, the Cisco ASR 9000 Series can support customer applications including video-on-demand, Internet Protocol Television (IPTV), point-to-point video, Internet video, and cloud-based computing. These line cards can also be used to deliver economical, scalable, highly available, line-rate Ethernet and IP/Multiprotocol Label Switching (IP/MPLS) edge services. The Cisco ASR 9000 Series line cards and routers are designed to provide the fundamental infrastructure for scalable Carrier Ethernet and IP/MPLS networks, supporting profitable business, residential, and mobile services The Cisco ASR 9000 Series modular line cards are fully compatible with the Cisco ASR 9922, 9010, and 9006 systems, route switch processors (RSPs), and line cards. No hardware upgrade to the chassis or cooling system is required. Total bandwidth is dependent on the number and type of RSPs installed. The new line cards deliver the ability to mix and match modular port adapters so that customers can customize each slot in the Cisco ASR 9000 to their specific port demands. As an example, a 4-port 10-Gigabit Ethernet modular port adapter can be matched with a 20-port 1-Gigabit Ethernet modular port adapter, all in a single slot. Each Cisco ASR 9000 Series modular line card provides simultaneous support for both Layer 2 and Layer 3 services and features, helping operators to qualify and stock a single line card that can be deployed in any combination of Layer 2 and Layer 3 applications. These capabilities help to reduce capital expenditures (CapEx) and operating expenses (OpEx), as well as reduce the time required to develop and deploy new services. The Cisco modular line cards set a new standard for service density, allowing operators to offer predictable, managed transport services while optimizing the use of network assets. The line cards, with their synchronization circuitry and dedicated backplane timing traces for accessing the RSP\u2019s Stratum-3 subsystem, provide standards-based line-interface functions for delivering and deriving transport-class network timing, allowing support of network-synchronized services and applications such as mobile backhaul and time-division multiplexing (TDM) migration. Coupled with the Cisco RSP-440 route switch processor, the line cards can also be used for applications requiring IEEE 1588v2 synchronization services. Recognizing that real-time media dominate next-generation services, Cisco has integrated media-monitoring technology into the Cisco Modular line cards. This multimedia technology allows real-time monitoring and statistics collection of real-time video and voice flows, facilitating proactive maintenance and management of today\u2019s interactive services. Addressing the advantages of consolidating IP and dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) networking, G.709 with Advanced Forward Error Correction (FEC) is provided. G.709 provides visibility into the DWDM transmission system to permit rapid detection and recovery from transmission-layer and DWDM impairments. G.709 can also be configured for proactive protection if signal degradation is detected; it prevents traffic loss and link outage. Advanced FEC extends transmission-layer performance, delivering extended performance over an amplified system without the cost of regeneration or transponders. The Cisco ASR 9000 Series modular line cards are available in Service Edge Optimized and Packet Transport Optimized variants.\u25cf Service Edge Optimized line cards are designed for customer deployments requiring enhanced quality of service (QoS).\u25cf Packet Transport Optimized line cards are designed for network deployments where basic QoS is required.Different line card types may be mixed within the same system.

Modular line cards support a wide range of interfaces and densities offering the benefits of network scalability with lower initial costs and ease of upgrades. The Cisco ASR 9000 modular line cards and modular port adapter portfolio continues the Cisco focus on investment protection along with consistent feature support, broad interface availability, and the latest technology.\nUsing the modular line cards, the Cisco ASR 9000 Series can support customer applications including video-on-demand, Internet Protocol Television (IPTV), point-to-point video, Internet video, and cloud-based computing. These line cards can also be used to deliver economical, scalable, highly available, line-rate Ethernet and IP/Multiprotocol Label Switching (IP/MPLS) edge services. The Cisco ASR 9000 Series line cards and routers are designed to provide the fundamental infrastructure for scalable Carrier Ethernet and IP/MPLS networks, supporting profitable business, residential, and mobile services\nThe Cisco ASR 9000 Series modular line cards are fully compatible with the Cisco ASR 9922, 9010, and 9006 systems, route switch processors (RSPs), and line cards. No hardware upgrade to the chassis or cooling system is required. Total bandwidth is dependent on the number and type of RSPs installed.\nThe new line cards deliver the ability to mix and match modular port adapters so that customers can customize each slot in the Cisco ASR 9000 to their specific port demands. As an example, a 4-port 10-Gigabit Ethernet modular port adapter can be matched with a 20-port 1-Gigabit Ethernet modular port adapter, all in a single slot.\nEach Cisco ASR 9000 Series modular line card provides simultaneous support for both Layer 2 and Layer 3 services and features, helping operators to qualify and stock a single line card that can be deployed in any combination of Layer 2 and Layer 3 applications. These capabilities help to reduce capital expenditures (CapEx) and operating expenses (OpEx), as well as reduce the time required to develop and deploy new services. The Cisco modular line cards set a new standard for service density, allowing operators to offer predictable, managed transport services while optimizing the use of network assets.\nThe line cards, with their synchronization circuitry and dedicated backplane timing traces for accessing the RSP\u2019s Stratum-3 subsystem, provide standards-based line-interface functions for delivering and deriving transport-class network timing, allowing support of network-synchronized services and applications such as mobile backhaul and time-division multiplexing (TDM) migration. Coupled with the Cisco RSP-440 route switch processor, the line cards can also be used for applications requiring IEEE 1588v2 synchronization services. Recognizing that real-time media dominate next-generation services, Cisco has integrated media-monitoring technology into the Cisco Modular line cards. This multimedia technology allows real-time monitoring and statistics collection of real-time video and voice flows, facilitating proactive maintenance and management of today\u2019s interactive services.\nAddressing the advantages of consolidating IP and dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) networking, G.709 with Advanced Forward Error Correction (FEC) is provided. G.709 provides visibility into the DWDM transmission system to permit rapid detection and recovery from transmission-layer and DWDM impairments. G.709 can also be configured for proactive protection if signal degradation is detected; it prevents traffic loss and link outage. Advanced FEC extends transmission-layer performance, delivering extended performance over an amplified system without the cost of regeneration or transponders.\nThe Cisco ASR 9000 Series modular line cards are available in Service Edge Optimized and Packet Transport Optimized variants.\u25cf Service Edge Optimized line cards are designed for customer deployments requiring enhanced quality of service (QoS).\u25cf Packet Transport Optimized line cards are designed for network deployments where basic QoS is required.Different line card types may be mixed within the same system.\nWe offer free FedEx Ground shipping to all our customers in the continental US.

As a result, enterprises can use it to deploy a high-density, low-latency, scalable architecture for powering a mission-critical data center. he 7700 F3-Series module is based on the Cisco Nexus F3-Series Switch-on-a-Chip (SoC) ASIC. This type of design increases performance while lowering the power and cooling requirements of the module. The F3-Series SoC is an innovative ASIC designed by Cisco and powered by a flexible packet engine that makes it particularly suitable for building the network infrastructure of public and private cloud environments. The F3-Series engine supports all the foundational networking protocols needed to build Layer 2 and Layer 3 networks, but it also can support highly virtualized environments. It can thus enable virtual overlay networking with hardware support for Cisco Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN) and Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) technologies. The 7700 F3-Series hardware enables customers to transparently interconnect their data centers with protocols such as Overlay Transport Virtualization (OTV) and Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS). The module delivers 720 million packets per second (mpps) of distributed Layer 2 and Layer 3 forwarding and up to 480 Gbps of data throughput. A 7700 18-Slot Switch fully populated with the 7700 F3-Series module can deliver up to 11.5 billion packets per second (bpps) and 15.4 terabits per second (Tbps) of switching performance. The 7700 F3-Series module integrates a broad set of data center switching technologies, including industry standards and Cisco's own innovations. It combines the benefits of classic fabric interface line cards with the advanced routing features of edge interface modules. With this integration, the module provides exceptional investment protection for organizations consolidating their data center environments while migrating to dense, multiservice 10 Gigabit Ethernet networks.  The 7700 F3-Series module is powered by the proven and comprehensive NX-OS feature set. This extremely comprehensive set of Layer 2 and Layer 3 functions makes this module excellent for data center networks, in which density, performance, and continuous system operation are critical. The 7700 F3-Series module is a critical enabler of Cisco FabricPath. With FabricPath, organizations can build resilient, flexible, and if needed, massively scalable Layer 2 networks. FabricPath protects enterprises' investments by allowing existing spanning-tree-based deployments to be connected to a FabricPath network. The 7700 F3-Series module can be used in conjunction with the Cisco Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extenders (FEX). The 2000 Series is designed to simplify data center architecture and operations by dramatically reducing the number of points of management. The 7700 F3-Series module delivers integrated Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE), greatly simplifying the network infrastructure and reducing costs by enabling the deployment of unified data center fabrics to consolidate data center traffic onto a single, general-purpose, high-performance, highly available network. With the 7700 F3-Series module, FCoE can be deployed in director-class modular platforms for the access layer and core of converged networks. The 7700 F3-Series module provides support for wire-rate VXLAN, offering the architectural flexibility needed to expand cloud deployments with repeatable pods in different Layer 2 domains. VXLAN can also enable migration of virtual machines between servers across Layer 3 networks. The support of advanced Data Center Interconnect (DCI) protocols such as Cisco OTV and VPLS makes the module excellent for helping customers simplify the extension of applications across geographically dispersed data center sites. The 7700 F3-Series module supports high-performance MPLS for 10 Gigabit Ethernet data center deployments. Support for Cisco LISP enables enterprises and service providers to simplify multihomed routing and facilitates scalable any-to-any WAN connectivity while supporting data center virtual machine mobility. The Virtual Device Context (VDC) feature helps enable the virtualization of a single physical device in one or more logical devices. Each provisioned logical device is configured and managed as if it were a separate physical device. The 7700 F3-Series module offers exceptional security with integrated hardware support for:  Configurable Control-Plane Policing (CoPP), which protects the supervisor CPU from excessive traffic Access Control List (ACL) counters and logging capability to provide deeper packet visibility Layer 2 to Layer 4 ACL for both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic Cisco TrustSec\u00ae technology, including line-rate data confidentiality, data integrity, and ACL processing for Security Group Tags (SGTs); data confidentiality and integrity conforming to the IEEE MAC security standard (IEEE 802.1AE MACsec) is supported on a subset of ports: more specifically, ports 41 to 48 (the rightmost eight ports) on the module support the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cipher, using a 128-bit key   Note: TrustSec SGT on the F3 Series Modules: F3 Series I/O modules require a dot1q header to be present for proper processing and transport of SGT-tagged packets. For Layer 2 switch ports use trunked interfaces instead of an access VLAN. Layer 3 interfaces should be configured as an L3 subinterface to force the dot1q over the L3 interconnection. \u00a0 We offer free FedEx Ground shipping to all our customers in the continental US.

By using Cisco ASR 901 routers, operators can reduce backhaul operating costs, simplify and converge their RAN and Ethernet access networks, and enhance their profit opportunities with mobile and premium Ethernet services.\nThe Cisco\u00ae ASR 901 Series Aggregation Services Routers are hardened, high-speed, low-power-consumption routers optimized for any-generation cell-site Radio Access Network (RAN) backhaul and Ethernet access. By using Cisco ASR 901 routers, operators can reduce backhaul operating costs, simplify and converge their RAN and Ethernet access networks, and enhance their profit opportunities with mobile and premium Ethernet services.RAN cell sites are places of transformation between mobile radio and mobile transport networks. Cost-effective RAN backhaul requires the ability to securely aggregate the transport of traffic from both traditional and next\u2011generation radios across multiple transport options available at the cell site, be they macro, pico, or enterprise small cells. The Cisco ASR 901 routers are designed to minimize operating costs and optimize this radio-to-transport transformation through scalable time-division multiplexing (TDM) and IP/Ethernet interfaces for any combination of multivendor, multigeneration radios and transport networks.Product OverviewThe Cisco ASR 901 Series Aggregation Services Routers are compact cell-site and Ethernet access routers specifically designed to clock, aggregate, and backhaul mixed-generation RAN traffic. Cisco ASR 901 routers prioritize and process cell-site voice, data, and signaling traffic as part of the Cisco Unified RAN Backhaul solution for reliable transport across any available backhaul networks, including T1/E1, ATM, Carrier Ethernet, microwave, WiMAX, and service provider Wi-Fi networks.Designed for cell sites and Carrier Ethernet access, the Cisco ASR 901 differentiating features include:\u25cf Low power consumption\u25cf Line rate performance for all Layer 2 and Layer 3 interfaces\u25cf Flexible clocking options: TDM, Building Integrated Timing Supply (BITS), GPS (10Mhz, 1PPS/ToD),1588v2, and Synchronous Ethernet (SyncE)\nMajor ApplicationsCell-Site Backhaul for Mobile ApplicationsDeployed as cell-site routers for mobile backhaul, the Cisco ASR 901 routers can aggregate multiple base stations through multiple TDM, Ethernet, and IP interfaces, and can use Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), Resilient Ethernet Protocol (REP), Multilink Point-to-Point Protocol (MLPPP), Layer 2 VPN (L2VPN), Layer 3 VPN (L3VPN), and other common transport protocols for RAN backhaul. Essentially, the routers prioritize, differentiate, and segment any combination of 2G, 3G, or 4G traffic for backhaul over any combination of IP/Ethernet and TDM (E1/T1) infrastructures (copper, microwave, or optical).Enterprise Small Cell BackhaulMobile traffic will now traverse from enterprise networks across public networks, so it is essential to protect the integrity of both enterprise and carrier data. To provide secure transport across any enterprise network, a high-performance IPSec acceleration engine is required. At the same time, it is important to be able to manage both public and private networks through support for NAPT. The Cisco ASR 901 provides secure mobile transport to satisfy the evolving backhaul requirements of deploying enterprise small cells.Metro Ethernet AccessCisco ASR 901 routers allow service providers to simultaneously manage and operate Pseudowire Emulation Edge to Edge (PWE3) and Carrier Ethernet environments by supporting line-rate Layer 2 Ethernet operations, administration, and maintenance (EOAM), including Connectivity Fault Management (CFM), Ethernet Local Management Interface (E-LMI), REP, QinQ, and link aggregation.Business Access DeviceCisco ASR 901 routers are optimized for remote-access and small aggregation sites where a fully featured, compact access platform is needed. The routers offer business service flexibility using an Ethernet virtual circuit (EVC) infrastructure and deliver Layer 2, IP, and MPLS transport for advanced Layer 2 and Layer 3 VPN services.\nBenefitsCisco ASR 901 routers help service providers deliver advanced services and reduce operating costs for mobile backhaul and Carrier Ethernet access solutions. Highlights include the following.Network SimplificationCisco network virtualization technology can simplify network operations by reducing the number of components that must be managed, supporting easier configuration. The Cisco ASR 901 supports Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) and autonomic networking and service activation to accelerate network deployment and service turn-up. The result is increased network scalability, improved service velocity, and lower operating costs. Capable of network virtualization, Cisco ASR 901 routers can be deployed as satellites of a Cisco ASR 9000 Series system to reduce the complexity of today\u2019s mobile Internet networks.Service ScalabilityCisco ASR 901 routers deliver line-rate performance and flexible service scalability in a compact form factor. With support for up to 32,000 MAC addresses, up to 4000 bridge domains, and multiple hierarchical queues, the routers deliver high performance and scale for all mobile and Carrier Ethernet services.Comprehensive ServicesWith Cisco ASR 901 routers, services can be prioritized and differentiated through hierarchical quality of service (HQoS) and security attributes. The routers offer advanced traffic analytics and performance monitoring and control, including per-traffic-class metering, bidirectional packets, and byte statistics. The service offering is enhanced with comprehensive OAM functionality, including Layer 2 CFM, IP service-level agreements (SLAs) for Layer 3, IPSec and NAPT for enterprise small cell backhaul, and MPLS OAM and TDM advanced timing and synchronization.Advanced TimingCisco ASR 901 routers provide the timing services required in today\u2019s converged access networks by offering integrated support for the BITS, 10-MHz, 1 pulse-per-second (PPS), and time-of-day (ToD) interfaces. The routers support SyncE on copper and optical ports and IEEE1588v2 Precision Time Protocol (PTP) clock recovery from T1 and E1 ports.Reliable DeploymentA Cisco end-to-end mobile backhaul solution offers the carrier greater confidence in the delivery of a truly carrier-class mobile backhaul network.

These cards combine WAN-interface-card (WIC), voice-interface-card (VIC), ISDN Primary Rate Interface (PRI), dial-access integration, and channelized-data (CE1T1) functions to provide superior flexibility, versatility, and investment protection through their many uses. Customers who choose to integrate data and voice in multiple steps preserve their investment in a T1/E1 WAN interface.\nYou can insert the Cisco T1/E1 NIMs into the NIM slot on the supported Cisco 4000 Integrated Services Routers (ISRs). In addition to the features listed in Table 1, these modules support both T1 and E1, providing additional flexibility for supporting T1, fractional T1, E1, and fractional E1 for both voice and WAN applications simultaneously. All modules include the drop-and-insert multiplexing capability, which eliminates costly external third-party channel service units/data service units (CSUs/DSUs) and drop-and-insert multiplexers.\nThe fourth-generation Cisco T1/E1 NIMs add improvements over the Cisco Second- and Third-Generation T1/E1 Multiflex Trunk Voice and WAN Interface Cards (MFT VWIC2s and VWIC3s, respectively). The fourth-generation T1/E1 modules enable each port to be clocked from an independent clock source for data applications. Voice applications can now be clocked independently from data applications, with all ports for voice applications clocked from a single source.\nThe T1/E1 modules contain an onboard Cisco Packet Voice Digital Signal Processor Module 4 (PVDM4) slot, which requires a fourth-generation PVDM4 module. A PVDM4 on the T1/E1 module is necessary for the voice features. The PVDM4 also provides for echo cancellation of up to 128-ms echo-tail length for demanding network conditions. Refer to Table 2 for all configuration options offered with the modules.\nThese fourth-generation modules also provide increased port density per chassis compared to the Cisco Integrated Services Routers Generation 2 (ISR G2) platform.\nKey Features\u25cf Basic T1/E1 data: The MFT versions act as WICs, supporting T1, fractional T1, E1, and fractional E1. To simplify remote management, these modules integrate a fully managed DSU/CSU for T1 deployments and a fully managed DSU for E1 deployments.\u25cf E1/G.703 data: In addition to the basic T1/E1 data support, the CE1T1 versions also support structured G.703 with G.704 framing and unstructured E1 (G.703) applications.\u25cf T1/E1 packet voice: All the modules support packet voice applications by providing T1, fractional T1, E1, and fractional E1 connections to private branch exchanges (PBXs) and central offices, thereby enabling new services and reducing voice and fax toll charges. An additional onboard PVDM4 is required. Also, each NIM has its own PVDM4, so each module can be connected to a different service provider with no single clock domain restriction.\u25cf Mixed data and packet voice: All the modules can simultaneously support both data and voice, reducing the complexity and number of network components and facilitating a graceful migration to bandwidth-efficient packet voice.\u25cf Mixed data and packet voice with drop and insert: You can deploy all the modules as T1/E1 drop-and-insert multiplexers with integrated DSUs/CSUs, reducing the complexity of the network and the cost of the central-office ports by efficiently combining time-division multiplexing (TDM) voice (PBX), IP voice, and data on the same trunks.\n"}, "product547": {"image": "https://www.networkoutlet.com/cdn/shop/products/WS-C3650-24PS-L_f60bc481-006a-4a88-82f2-5eb91ac0ff1c_300x300.jpg?v=1588705129", "title": "WS-C3650-24TS-L Cisco Catalyst 3650 24-port GigE/4xGigE Uplinks, LAN Base", "brand": "Cisco", "price": "$400.00", "description": "\nWS-C3650-24TS-L Cisco Catalyst 3650 24-port GigE/4xGigE Uplinks, LAN Base\nThe Cisco\u00ae Catalyst\u00ae 3650 Series is the next generation of enterprise-class standalone and stackable access-layer switches that provide the foundation for full convergence between wired and wireless on a single platform.

Modular line cards support a wide range of interfaces and densities offering the benefits of network scalability with lower initial costs and ease of upgrades. The Cisco ASR 9000 modular line cards and modular port adapter portfolio continues the Cisco focus on investment protection along with consistent feature support, broad interface availability, and the latest technology. Using the modular line cards, the Cisco ASR 9000 Series can support customer applications including video-on-demand, Internet Protocol Television (IPTV), point-to-point video, Internet video, and cloud-based computing. These line cards can also be used to deliver economical, scalable, highly available, line-rate Ethernet and IP/Multiprotocol Label Switching (IP/MPLS) edge services. The Cisco ASR 9000 Series line cards and routers are designed to provide the fundamental infrastructure for scalable Carrier Ethernet and IP/MPLS networks, supporting profitable business, residential, and mobile services The Cisco ASR 9000 Series modular line cards are fully compatible with the Cisco ASR 9922, 9010, and 9006 systems, route switch processors (RSPs), and line cards. No hardware upgrade to the chassis or cooling system is required. Total bandwidth is dependent on the number and type of RSPs installed. The new line cards deliver the ability to mix and match modular port adapters so that customers can customize each slot in the Cisco ASR 9000 to their specific port demands. As an example, a 4-port 10-Gigabit Ethernet modular port adapter can be matched with a 20-port 1-Gigabit Ethernet modular port adapter, all in a single slot. Each Cisco ASR 9000 Series modular line card provides simultaneous support for both Layer 2 and Layer 3 services and features, helping operators to qualify and stock a single line card that can be deployed in any combination of Layer 2 and Layer 3 applications. These capabilities help to reduce capital expenditures (CapEx) and operating expenses (OpEx), as well as reduce the time required to develop and deploy new services. The Cisco modular line cards set a new standard for service density, allowing operators to offer predictable, managed transport services while optimizing the use of network assets. The line cards, with their synchronization circuitry and dedicated backplane timing traces for accessing the RSP\u2019s Stratum-3 subsystem, provide standards-based line-interface functions for delivering and deriving transport-class network timing, allowing support of network-synchronized services and applications such as mobile backhaul and time-division multiplexing (TDM) migration. Coupled with the Cisco RSP-440 route switch processor, the line cards can also be used for applications requiring IEEE 1588v2 synchronization services. Recognizing that real-time media dominate next-generation services, Cisco has integrated media-monitoring technology into the Cisco Modular line cards. This multimedia technology allows real-time monitoring and statistics collection of real-time video and voice flows, facilitating proactive maintenance and management of today\u2019s interactive services. Addressing the advantages of consolidating IP and dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) networking, G.709 with Advanced Forward Error Correction (FEC) is provided. G.709 provides visibility into the DWDM transmission system to permit rapid detection and recovery from transmission-layer and DWDM impairments. G.709 can also be configured for proactive protection if signal degradation is detected; it prevents traffic loss and link outage. Advanced FEC extends transmission-layer performance, delivering extended performance over an amplified system without the cost of regeneration or transponders. The Cisco ASR 9000 Series modular line cards are available in Service Edge Optimized and Packet Transport Optimized variants.\u25cf Service Edge Optimized line cards are designed for customer deployments requiring enhanced quality of service (QoS).\u25cf Packet Transport Optimized line cards are designed for network deployments where basic QoS is required.Different line card types may be mixed within the same system.

These cards combine WAN-interface-card (WIC), voice-interface-card (VIC), ISDN Primary Rate Interface (PRI), dial-access integration, and channelized-data (CE1T1) functions to provide superior flexibility, versatility, and investment protection through their many uses. Customers who choose to integrate data and voice in multiple steps preserve their investment in a T1/E1 WAN interface.\nYou can insert the Cisco T1/E1 NIMs into the NIM slot on the supported Cisco 4000 Integrated Services Routers (ISRs). In addition to the features listed in Table 1, these modules support both T1 and E1, providing additional flexibility for supporting T1, fractional T1, E1, and fractional E1 for both voice and WAN applications simultaneously. All modules include the drop-and-insert multiplexing capability, which eliminates costly external third-party channel service units/data service units (CSUs/DSUs) and drop-and-insert multiplexers.\nThe fourth-generation Cisco T1/E1 NIMs add improvements over the Cisco Second- and Third-Generation T1/E1 Multiflex Trunk Voice and WAN Interface Cards (MFT VWIC2s and VWIC3s, respectively). The fourth-generation T1/E1 modules enable each port to be clocked from an independent clock source for data applications. Voice applications can now be clocked independently from data applications, with all ports for voice applications clocked from a single source.\nThe T1/E1 modules contain an onboard Cisco Packet Voice Digital Signal Processor Module 4 (PVDM4) slot, which requires a fourth-generation PVDM4 module. A PVDM4 on the T1/E1 module is necessary for the voice features. The PVDM4 also provides for echo cancellation of up to 128-ms echo-tail length for demanding network conditions. Refer to Table 2 for all configuration options offered with the modules.\nThese fourth-generation modules also provide increased port density per chassis compared to the Cisco Integrated Services Routers Generation 2 (ISR G2) platform.\nKey Features\u25cf Basic T1/E1 data: The MFT versions act as WICs, supporting T1, fractional T1, E1, and fractional E1. To simplify remote management, these modules integrate a fully managed DSU/CSU for T1 deployments and a fully managed DSU for E1 deployments.\u25cf E1/G.703 data: In addition to the basic T1/E1 data support, the CE1T1 versions also support structured G.703 with G.704 framing and unstructured E1 (G.703) applications.\u25cf T1/E1 packet voice: All the modules support packet voice applications by providing T1, fractional T1, E1, and fractional E1 connections to private branch exchanges (PBXs) and central offices, thereby enabling new services and reducing voice and fax toll charges. An additional onboard PVDM4 is required. Also, each NIM has its own PVDM4, so each module can be connected to a different service provider with no single clock domain restriction.\u25cf Mixed data and packet voice: All the modules can simultaneously support both data and voice, reducing the complexity and number of network components and facilitating a graceful migration to bandwidth-efficient packet voice.\u25cf Mixed data and packet voice with drop and insert: You can deploy all the modules as T1/E1 drop-and-insert multiplexers with integrated DSUs/CSUs, reducing the complexity of the network and the cost of the central-office ports by efficiently combining time-division multiplexing (TDM) voice (PBX), IP voice, and data on the same trunks.\n"}, "product717": {"image": "https://www.networkoutlet.com/cdn/shop/products/3650-stack_300x300.jpg?v=1636050745", "title": "C3650-STACK Cisco Catalyst 3650 Stack Module", "brand": "Cisco", "price": "$250.00", "description": "\nThis is a single stacking module for the Cisco 3650 switches.\u00a0 If you need both stacking modules and cable, please purchase a C3650-STACK-KIT\nCisco Catalyst 3650 Stacking Module for the Cisco 3650 Series Switches.\u00a0\u00a0\nPart Number:\u00a0 C3650-STACK\n\u00a0\n"}, "product718": {"image": "https://www.networkoutlet.com/cdn/shop/products/N3K-C3064-FAN__87685_300x300.jpg?v=1625770539", "title": "N3K-C3064-FAN Cisco Nexus 3064 Fan Module, Standard Airflow", "brand": "Cisco", "price": "$250.00", "description": "\nN3K-C3064-FAN Cisco Nexus 3064 Fan Module, Standard Airflow/Port Side Exhaust We offer free FedEx Ground shipping to all our customers in the continental US.

Transparently integrated into the enterprise-class feature set available on the Cisco 880 Series, 3G, and WiFi wireless connectivity allows for rapid installation, deployment flexibility, and resilient mobile broadband backhaul for primary, WAN backup, and WiFi LAN.\nProduct Overview\nCisco 880 Series Integrated Services Routers are the next generation of fixed-configuration routers that provide collaborative business solutions for secure data communication to small businesses and enterprise teleworkers. The embedded 3G wireless on these routers offers a cost-effective, rapidly deployable, reliable, and secure backup solution. With data rates exceeding T1 speeds, 3G wireless can be used for primary WAN connectivity in locations where wire-line services such as DSL and ISDN are not available or are too expensive to deploy.\nThe Cisco 880G Series Integrated Services Routers support the latest 3G standards (Evolved High-Speed Packet Access [HSPA+] and Evolved Data Optimized Revision A [EV-DO Rev A]) and are backward-compatible with High-Speed Packet Access (HSPA), Universal Mobile Telecommunications Service (UMTS), Enhanced Data Rates for Global Evolution (EDGE), General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), and EV-DO Rev 0/1xRTT. The Cisco 880G Series has two variants (refer to Table 1 for part numbers):\n\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) and UMTS models are based on the Third-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), and they support 3.7G HSPA+, 3.5G HSPA (Evolved High-Speed Packet Access HSPA+/HSPA]), UMTS, EDGE, and GPRS.\n\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) models are based on 3GPP2, and they support EV-DO Rev A/Rev 0 and 1xRTT.\nIn addition to 3G wireless WAN, the Cisco 880G Series offers additional WAN options such as Next-Generation xDSL and Fast Ethernet WAN interface, a 4-port 10/100 Fast Ethernet managed switch with VLAN support and the latest 802.11n WLAN* capability with dual radio. The Cisco 880 Series provides the performance required for concurrent services, including firewall, intrusion prevention, content filtering, and encryption for VPNs; and quality-of-service (QoS) features for optimizing voice and video applications. In addition, Cisco Configuration Professional is a web-based configuration tool that simplifies setup and deployment. Centralized management capabilities give network managers visibility and control of the network configurations at the remote site.\nBusinesses are looking for ways to reduce costs, increase revenue, and improve business continuity. Third-generation wireless connectivity allows a small enterprise branch office or remote office to set up in a matter of hours, without worrying about availability of broadband services and the need for laying down the lines. Wireless carriers offer flexible, usage-based data plans that can be catered to meet the needs and price points of the business customer. As a WAN backup alternative, 3G wireless offers greater WAN diversity and resiliency because it is independent of the local terrestrial infrastructure. It enables businesses to stay productive during service provider downtime or a network failure.\nThe dual 802.11a/b/g/n 2X3 MIMO inbuilt Access Point (AP) in the Cisco 880(G)W , comes with Cisco\u2019s CleanAir technology, Industry\u2019s first to create a self-healing, self-optimizing wireless network. Moreover, with the advantage of dual radio, the Cisco AP can serve both as an AP and as a client to a wireless mesh network concurrently: Hence providing another source for WAN diversity along with GE interface, cellular. Additionally, the ClientLink feature on the AP improves reliability and coverage for legacy devices and the capability to do dynamic frequency selection (DFS) allows detecting and avoiding interfering with radar signals to comply with regulatory domains.\n\u00a0\nWith enhanced data rates and improved latency (below 100 milliseconds), WWAN services are an ideal way to supplement traditional wire-line services. Third-generation WWAN data services offered today have average data rates well in excess of ISDN speeds, with theoretical limits in excess of 21.1 Mbps on the downlink and 5.76 Mbps on the uplink. You can use the 3G WWAN as a primary link for sites with lower bandwidth requirements and for mobile applications. You can also use the 3G WWAN data services as a cost-effective alternative in areas where broadband services are either not available or very expensive. Cisco is building on these performance milestones and adding support for wireless to our wide variety of WAN interface alternatives.\n\u00a0\n"}, "product945": {"image": "https://www.networkoutlet.com/cdn/shop/products/cisco-ds-sfp-fc32g-sw-rf_300x300.jpg?v=1625770499", "title": "DS-SFP-FC32G-SW Cisco MDS 9000 32GB FC SFP SW", "brand": "Cisco", "price": "$125.00", "description": "\nThe Cisco 32-Gbps Fibre Channel SFP+ Transceivers provide Fibre Channel connectivity for 4/8/16/32-Gbps ports on the MDS 9000 Family platform.
